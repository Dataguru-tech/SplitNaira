# Postgres Backup & Restore Runbook (Issue #839)

> **Issue:** #839
> **Track:** Stellar Wave
> **Status:** Complete
> **Related:** [`audit-log-retention.md`](../audit-log-retention.md), [`runbooks/rollback-guide.md`](../../runbooks/rollback-guide.md), [`runbooks/incident-management.md`](./incident-management.md), [`runbooks/observability.md`](./observability.md)

This runbook gives operators a concrete, drill-tested procedure for backing up
the SplitNaira Postgres database, restoring it without losing audit log or
transaction history, and verifying the result before traffic is routed
back. **Treat this as the authoritative procedure** for any environment
(dev, staging, or production) — ad-hoc `pg_dump` runs are not a substitute.

---

## 1. Backup cadence

| Environment | Frequency | Retention window | Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Production** | Continuous (managed automated snapshot every 6 h) + **nightly logical dump retained 30 d** | 30 d nightly + 7 d point-in-time recovery | Managed snapshot + `pg_dump` |
| **Staging** | Nightly at 02:00 UTC | 14 d nightly | `pg_dump` |
| **Dev / CI** | On-demand only | Best-effort | `pg_dump` or ephemeral DB |

Recovery objectives for production:

- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** ≤ 6 hours (covers automated snapshots) and ≤ 24 hours when only nightly logical dumps remain.
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** ≤ 1 hour for restoring from a managed snapshot, ≤ 2 hours for restoring from a logical dump.

## 2. Backup commands

### 2.1 Managed snapshot (Render, AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL)

Use the provider's snapshot or automated-backup feature. Capture the
snapshot ID before any incident so it can be referenced during a restore.

```bash
# Render: trigger a manual managed snapshot
render services snapshot create --service-id <backend-service-id>

# AWS RDS: immediate snapshot
aws rds create-db-snapshot \
  --db-instance-identifier splitnaira-prod \
  --db-snapshot-identifier splitnaira-prod-predeploy-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ) \
  --tags Key=Purpose,Value=predeploy

# GCP Cloud SQL
gcloud sql backups create --instance splitnaira-prod --location us-central1
```

Always tag the snapshot with the deploy commit SHA and the ticket /
incident ID that triggered it.

### 2.2 Logical dump with `pg_dump`

Use a read replica or the primary with `--single-transaction` so
in-flight writes are not interrupted. Save the dump to durable blob
storage (S3/GCS) and to a secure local copy.

```bash
DUMP_PATH=/var/backups/splitnaira/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).dump
pg_dump \
  --dbname="$DATABASE_URL" \
  --format=custom \
  --no-owner \
  --no-privileges \
  --single-transaction \
  --verbose \
  --file="$DUMP_PATH"

# Encrypt before off-host upload
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 "$DUMP_PATH"
```

Verify the dump is non-empty and the file's md5 matches a sidecar.

```bash
ls -lah "$DUMP_PATH".gpg
md5sum "$DUMP_PATH".gpg | tee "$DUMP_PATH".gpg.md5
```

### 2.3 Automated nightly dump (cron or scheduler)

```cron
# m h d M w  command
0 2 * * *  /usr/local/bin/splitnaira-nightly-pgdump.sh >> /var/log/splitnaira-pgdump.log 2>&1
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# /usr/local/bin/splitnaira-nightly-pgdump.sh
set -euo pipefail
DUMP_PATH=/var/backups/splitnaira/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).dump
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" --format=custom --no-owner --no-privileges \
  --single-transaction --file="$DUMP_PATH"
gpg --batch --yes --passphrase-file /etc/splitnaira/dump-passphrase \
  --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 "$DUMP_PATH"
rm "$DUMP_PATH"
aws s3 cp "$DUMP_PATH".gpg "s3://splitnaira-backups/$(date -u +%Y/%m/%d)/"
```

## 3. Restore drill

> Run this drill at least **once per quarter** against a disposable
> staging database so the procedure is current and the team has muscle
> memory. The issue #839 acceptance criteria explicitly call this out.

### 3.1 Provision a disposable database

```bash
# Example: spin up an empty Postgres 16 container
docker run --rm --detach \
  --name splitnaira-restore-drill \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=splitnaira -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=splitnaira \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=splitnaira_drill \
  -p 5433:5432 \
  postgres:16
```

### 3.2 Decrypt and restore

```bash
DUMP_GPG=/var/backups/splitnaira/chosen.dump.gpg
DUMP_PATH=/tmp/splitnaira-restore.dump
gpg --batch --yes --passphrase-file /etc/splitnaira/dump-passphrase \
  --decrypt "$DUMP_GPG" > "$DUMP_PATH"

pg_restore \
  --dbname=postgresql://splitnaira:splitnaira@localhost:5433/splitnaira_drill \
  --no-owner --no-privileges \
  --single-transaction \
  --verbose \
  "$DUMP_PATH"
```

After the restore, re-apply any pending migrations **from the same
backend version that produced the dump**. Re-applying in reverse order
is unsafe — sort them by timestamp and apply oldest-first.

### 3.3 Verification queries

Run these against the restored database immediately after the restore.
All of them must return non-empty / non-error responses before traffic
is allowed back.

```sql
-- Row-count sanity check (expect > 0 for active tables)
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users)         AS user_rows,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM splits)        AS split_rows,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions)  AS transaction_rows,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audit_log)     AS audit_log_rows;

-- Cross-check: every split has at least one transaction
SELECT s.id
FROM splits s
LEFT JOIN transactions t ON t.split_id = s.id
WHERE t.id IS NULL;

-- Audit-log integrity: time-ordered inserts in the last 30 days
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('hour', performed_at) AS hour,
       COUNT(*) AS actions
FROM audit_log
WHERE performed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;

-- Latest transaction timestamp matches expectations
SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM transactions;
```

A simple shell wrapper that returns non-zero on any anomaly:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# /usr/local/bin/splitnaira-restore-verify.sh
set -euo pipefail
DATABASE_URL="$1"
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -At <<'SQL'
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) = 0                 THEN 'empty_users'
    WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM splits) = 0                THEN 'empty_splits'
    WHEN EXISTS(
      SELECT 1 FROM splits s
      LEFT JOIN transactions t ON t.split_id = s.id
      WHERE t.id IS NULL
    )                                                    THEN 'orphan_split'
    ELSE 'ok'
  END;
SQL
```

### 3.4 Application smoke check

Once the verification passes, point a temporary backend instance at
the drill database and run the standard smoke checks
(see [`runbooks/production-readiness.md`](../../runbooks/production-readiness.md)):

```bash
BACKEND_BASE=https://<temp-backend-host>
curl -fsS "$BACKEND_BASE/health/ready"            # expect 200 ok
curl -fsS "$BACKEND_BASE/splits?limit=5"          # expect non-empty list
curl -fsS "$BACKEND_BASE/transactions/history?limit=5" # expect prior records
```

## 4. Audit log & transaction record handling

Audit logs and transaction records **must be preserved across any
restore**. The SplitNaira operational model treats them as compliance
artefacts with a defined retention policy
(see [`audit-log-retention.md`](../audit-log-retention.md)).

| Concern | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Audit log retention in backup | **Keep full audit history** in every backup | Compressed retention starts *after* restore is verified safe. |
| Backups older than the audit retention window (2 years) | **Still retain the dump**, even if rows inside no longer match active retention | Backups are evidence, not active data. |
| Transactions in `transactions` table | **Always restore** | They drive downstream payout history and SSE event projection. |
| Token allowlist (read from contract, mirrored in `audit_log`) | **Always restore** | Mirrored allowlist writes are part of the audit trail. |
| Temporary `audit_log` rows from QA automation | **Allow restore** but mark with `request_id` prefix `qa-` | Easier to filter if ever needed. |

> **Important:** Never delete or shorten the `audit_log` table as part of
> a restore. The retention sweep in `audit-log-retention.md` is a
> separate, quarterly stand-alone operation that runs **after** the
> rest of the system is confirmed healthy.

## 5. Rollback considerations during restore

If the restore is being performed *because* of a failing deploy or
illegal data shape, follow these rules to avoid rolling forward into a
worse state:

1. **Freeze writes first.** Set `PAYMENTS_ADMIN_WRITE_ENABLED=false`
   on the *currently-live* backend and stop accepting new traffic at
   the load balancer before the restore begins. The freeze is the same
   switch documented in [`runbooks/rollback-guide.md`](../../runbooks/rollback-guide.md#1-backend-service-rollback).
2. **Restore to a parallel instance, not in-place.** Point the new
   backend at the restored database and verify it before swapping the
   load balancer. In-place restoration requires turning the database
   fully offline, which is rarely justified.
3. **Keep both databases online until parity checks pass.** Compare row
   counts and `MAX(timestamps)` against the pre-restore live database —
   see [`runbooks/observability.md`](./observability.md) for the
   parity queries.
4. **If restore succeeds but parity fails**, do **not** flip traffic.
   Investigate the discrepancy before cutting over. The
   contract-side authoritative state continues to be reconciled by
   `/health/ready`; treat DB-only state divergence as a
   P2 incident.
5. **If restore fails mid-flight**, drop the partial database and start
   again — never try to "patch" a half-restored database.
6. **Capture the deploy commit SHA and incident ID in the restore
   notes** so the post-incident review links the restore to the
   triggering change.

## 6. Quick-reference cheat sheet

```bash
# Snapshot the live DB before any risky change
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" --format=custom --no-owner --no-privileges \
  --single-transaction --verbose \
  --file=/var/backups/splitnaira/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ).dump

# Encrypted upload
gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 \
  /var/backups/splitnaira/<stamp>.dump

# Verify a dump
gpg --decrypt /var/backups/splitnaira/<stamp>.dump.gpg > /tmp/check.dump
pg_restore --list /tmp/check.dump | head -50

# Restore into a disposable DB
createdb -h localhost -p 5433 splitnaira_drill
pg_restore --dbname=postgresql://splitnaira:splitnaira@localhost:5433/splitnaira_drill \
  --no-owner --no-privileges --single-transaction /tmp/check.dump

# Verify
psql postgresql://splitnaira:splitnaira@localhost:5433/splitnaira_drill \
  -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM splits;"
```
